Optimize react app :
1. Using functional components or using React.PureComponents. Functional component avoid creating instatnce thus minification bundle size reduced . 
Also class components increase the state lifecycle . React purecomponents uses shallow comparision so need to be more causious

2. webPack Optimizations
  a. using SplitPlugin (from webpack4 ) or chunkPlugins (before webpack 4 ) it splits vendor specific files and our code in two differnet chunks. 
  using split chunks we could use dynamix import chunks , reduce redundent code 
  b. Dependency optimization plugin like moment-locale-optimization plugin. 
  If we don't have internationalization we coiuld avoid unused locale files 
  
3. React.Fragments avoind using extra node for child elements
4. Use of inline functions inside render method. 
So that on every render it will avoind creating new instance of that function followed by incrasing garbge collections.
5. Usage of reselect in redux for caching purpose
6. Memoize react component
7. using CDN usage to get the static resource from nearest edge servers
8. Using web pack bundle analyzer we could analise the bundle size and which module eating the size
9. Serverside rendering for server intensive operation
10.Gip the bundle
